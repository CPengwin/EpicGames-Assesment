# EpicGames-Assesment

This repository contains my analysis and recommendations based on a take-home data assessment. The project focuses on evaluating game performance metrics and making data-driven recommendations to stakeholders. Below is a brief overview of the exercises and my approach to addressing each.
Exercise 1: A/B Test Evaluation

The goal was to analyze data from a test conducted on a gameâ€™s download webpage to determine whether Variant A or Variant B should be rolled out. Key tasks included:

1. Evaluating performance metrics such as conversion rates and player engagement across variants.
2. Providing a clear recommendation for non-technical stakeholders, supported by visualizations and concise explanations.

## Deliverable:
A summary report presenting findings and actionable recommendations, written in a format accessible to non-technical stakeholders.
Exercise 3: Player Activity Analysis

This task involved analyzing player behavior using two datasets:

1. Exercise3_installs.csv: Contains player installation data.
2. Exercise3_activity.csv: Tracks daily player activity, including matches started, completed, and won.

## Analysis Objectives:

  1. Understand player retention and engagement trends over time.
  2. Identify geographic patterns in player activity.
  3. Summarize game performance and provide actionable recommendations for stakeholders.

## Deliverables:

  1. Summary Report: A detailed overview of key insights and recommendations.
  2. Code and Workbook: Python scripts and SQL queries used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Insights

The main plot is shown below for exercise #3 and indicates that: 
**Yes, there is a trending decline in users with a strong correlation between matches finished and retention rate.**
